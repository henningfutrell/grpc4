This project focuses on the distributed server aspect.

New protocols need to be established to:
- Elect new available server
- Route traffic to appropriate server
- Alert client that current server crashed

Because I use bidirectional streaming, I need to find the gRpc equivalent of a
connection lost message. When connection is lost the client will poll the router
server for a new ip/port. This should be available in channel state or similar.
